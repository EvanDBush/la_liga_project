Project: 
    Exploring Spanish Soccer League (la liga) data from 1929-2022


Goals: 

- Calculate winning and losing totals by teams.
- Calculate winning and losing streaks for Barcelona.
- Use data to give teams points of wins, draws, and losses.
- Use data to calculate Standings and Winners for each season.

- Make a function that takes a season and team and returns their schedule and results
- Make a function that takes in a team and returns total wins, draws, and losses.

if I add data:

- Extend these methods to other leagues.
- Cross data with coaches for specific team. (Barcelona)
- Compare coaches winning percentages.

- Compare wins and losses pre-Messi, during Messi and post Messi.



Features:

(x) 1. Read in data from a local csv, excel file, json, or any other
file type. There are many ways to do this, but using
Pandas read_ functions is pretty easy.

(x) 2. Use at least 5 different built-in Python functions to find out
something about your data. If you had a list for example,
finding the length of that list with len(<list>) does tell us a
little bit about the data.

() 3. Do 5 basic calculations with
Pandas, like finding the
sum(), median(), mean(), or
mode() of a column. You
could divide two columns by
each other. You could
multiple a column by a
random integer. You could
use string operations and find
the most common letter in a
given entry.

() 4. Make 2 basic plots with
matplotlib, seaborn, or any
other kind of visualization
library that you think looks
interesting.

(x) 5. Write markdown cells in
Jupyter explaining your
thought process and code. If
you make a few plots with
matplotlib, explain what the
reader is seeing and why you
chose to plot things that way.
